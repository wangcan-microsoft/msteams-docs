<summary><b>How can I switch to another Azure subscription while provisioning?</b></summary>

1. Switch subscription in current account or sign out and select a new subscription.
2. If you've already provisioned current environment, you need to create a new environment and perform provision because ARM doesn't support moving resources.
3. If you didn't provision current environment, you can trigger provision directly.
